Changelog for ASP4x::Linker:

2012-05-07      v1.002
  - DEPRECATED
  - ASP4 has been marked as deprecated, and so this module follows suit.

2012-03-16      v1.002
  - Disabled some failing tests temporarily until we can fix them.

2012-02-03      v1.001
  - Added chained widget-attribute-setters.
    $widget->set(foo => 'bar', ...)->uri();
    $widget->set(%args)->set(%more_args)->uri();
  - Thanks to eric.hayes++ for the suggestion.

2011-05-01      v1.000
  - $widget->set( non_existent_attribute => "value" ) will result in an exception.
  - Simplified the documentation for ASP4x::Linker - the simplified style of
    $linker->widget(...)->get/set(...) interface is very much preferred.
  - API has otherwise remained unchanged for over a year.  Time to go v1.000!!!

2010-05-13      v0.003
  - Now, $linker->uri({foo => 'bar'}) returns a uri with foo=bar in there someplace.
  - Upgrade recommended.

  - Added vars() method.
  - Updated docs.
  - Removed AUTOLOAD behavior from Widget and Linker.
  - Added $widget->get( $attr ) and $widget->set( $attr => $value )
  - Added $widget->on_change( $attr => sub { ... } )
  - Added several tests.

2010-04-01      v0.001
  - Initial release.
  - No joke!
